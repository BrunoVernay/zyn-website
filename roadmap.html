        <h2>A Slow Build</h2>
        <p>
        Building up from 2002 release, ZynAddSubFX was built to have a large
        variety of features including the core synthesis features that are
        familiar to current users.
        This is when the core synthesis modules for
        <b>additive synthesis</b>, <b>subtractive synthesis</b>,
        and a novel <b>pad synthesizer</b> were formed.
        You'd also see other familiar synth staples in the repertoire of
        features such as <b>ADSR/Custom envelopes</b>, a wide variety of
        <b>filters</b>, <b>frequency modulation</b>,
        <b>amplitude modulation</b>, and others. 
        This combined with the microtonal aware engine and numerous effects
        makes ZynAddSubFX a powerful synth.
        Towards the tail end of this series ZynAddSubFX was available on
        windows, linux, and osx.

        <h2>Incremental Revitalization</h2>
        <p>After a lull in development from 2.2.1's last release in 2005, the
        2.4.0 series resumed active development in 2009.
        This series was the debut for <b>legato mode</b>
        and <b>additive synth unison</b>.
        The older configuration system was replaced with <b>cmake</b> which
        integrated well with the runtime selectable MIDI and Audio driver
        support.
        Some initial work in plugin and session management was also performed at
        this stage achieving <b>DSSI</b> and <b>non session manager</b> support.
        Due to development limitations this series was nearly exclusively Linux
        based.

        <h2>Architecture &amp; External Control</h2>
        <p>After the initial revitalization efforts, there were rather clear
        architectural limitations created in the pre 2.4.x series. The 2.5.x
        series was built to resolve these limitations and it has resulted in
        major improvements in <b>hard realtime performance</b>.
        The redesigned internals have resulted in a decoupled interface which
        works via <b>remote Open Sound Control</b> (OSC).
        This new interface has opened up the possibility of near ubiquitous
        <b>MIDI learn</b> and increasing support for
        <b>realtime automations</b>.
        Support for a <b>VST</b> and <b>LV2</b> plugin was added in this series.
        This series is developed on Linux with support offered for OSX.

        <h2>Workflow &amp; Interfaces</h2>
        <p>A major limitation in past versions was the fltk based user
        interface.
        The navigation of the fltk UI is complex and parameter changes do
        not have an obvious effect within the interface.
        A complete rewrite of the user interface has begin using the OSC api
        created in the 2.5.x series.
        This series will result in a <b>single window</b> user interface uniting the
        numerous views of the current UI.
        Parameters will have associated <b>data visualizations</b> easily
        available to help users understand how parameter changes should be
        expected to change their instruments without consulting documentation.
        This release is expected to support Windows, Linux, and OSX.

        <h2>Polish &amp; Iteration On Feedback</h2>
        <p>While the 2.5.x changed the internals and the 3.0.x series radically
        changed the interface, the 3.1.x series will be much more minor.
        This release will focus on <b>workflow</b> changes based upon feedback
        in both user surveys and public discussion on how people use the 3.0.x
        series.
        These incremental changes better parameter manipulation in terms of
        direct units (Hz, cents, dB, ...), or changing how visualizations can be
        interacted with.
        Ideally sound manipulation should be fast, direct, and easy.
        This series should clean up loose ends from the 3.0.x series to ensure
        this is true and ZynAddSubFX should become by and large feature complete
        in this series.
        This release is expected to support Windows, Linux, and OSX.
