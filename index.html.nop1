    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    <b>ZynAddSubFX</b> is a open source software synthesizer capable
    of making a countless number of instruments, from some common
    heard from expensive hardware to interesting sounds that you'll
    boost to an amazing universe of sounds.</p>
    <p>The project was started in March 2002 by Nasca Octavian Paul.
    He began to write ZynAddSubFX in order to create a synthesizer
    which could produce beautiful sounds, while being freely available to
    anybody who needs it.</p>

    <h2>Features of ZynAddSubFX:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Realtime</b> synth</li>
      <li><b>Polyphonic</b> synth <i>(allows playing more than one note at
        once)</i></li>
      <li><b>Mutlitimbral</b> synth <i>(allows playing more than one
        instrument at once)</i></li>
      <li><b>Microtonal</b> capabilities with any scale, up to 128 
        notes per octave, and key mapping</li>

  <li>Three synthesizer engines:
    <ol type="1"><li>"<b>ADsynth</b>" or  "<b>ADnote</b>" is
        a complex engine which makes sounds by adding a number of voices.
        Each one has filters, envelopes, LFOs, morphing, modulation (Ring
        Modulation, Phase Modulation... the modulators can have any
        shape), resonance, etc. Each voice includes a very powerful
        waveform generator with up to 128 sine/non-sine harmonics. You can
        use Fourier synthesis or if you don't like it you can
        wave-shaping/filtering of functions. This engine includes
        anti-aliasing.</li>
        <li>"<b>SUBsynth</b>" or "<b>SUBnote</b>" is a
        simple engine which makes sounds through subtraction of
        harmonics from white noise</li>
        <li>"<b>PADsynth</b>" or "<b>PADnote</b>" is engine
        that makes very beautiful pads and other
        instruments. (these instruments can be exported for use with
        other programs too)</li></ol></li>
  <li>Legato, Poly, and Mono modes</li>
  <li>Instruments can be organized in kits, which allows you to make
    drum kits or layered(mixed) instruments; this makes possible to
    use more than one instrument for a single part. It is possible to
    choose what items from the kit should be processed by the Part's
    effects.</li>
  <li><b>Effects</b>:
    <ul><li>Reverb, Echo, Chorus/Flange, Phaser, AlienWah (it's a kind of
      vocal morpher), Distortion(Wave-shaping), EQ, DynamicFilter</li>
      <li>The effects can
        behave as <b>System Effects</b> or as <b>Insertion Effects</b>;
        this allows to use many effects at the same time. You can put any
        insertion effect on any part(or more insertion effects to same
        parts, if you like so) or you can put the insertion effect to
        Master output (very useful if you use the EQ effect). Also, you
        can have instrument's effect (which save with the instrument).
      </li></ul></li>
  <li>Filters up to
  <b>60dB/octave</b> (or more..); filters can be <b>analogic</b>
    (LPF,HPF, BPF,etc.), <b>formant</b>(advanced formant
    filters) and state variable (SVF)</li>
  <li>Envelopes can have
    ADSR (or ASR, etc..) modes or can be free modes (with any
    shape)</li>
  <li>Many settings have a
    "<b>randomness</b>" option, which you can make instruments that
    every time produces a subtle different sound; this produces a
    very pleasant effect (like analogue synths or natural instruments
    that can't produces exactly same sound twice). Because of this,
    even if it is digital synthesis, it sounds "warm". Listen the ogg
    vorbis demos from this page to hear this effect.</li>
  <li>The specifications
    can be easily changed, so (for example) if you want to change the
    number of voices or parts to a higher value or to allow a higher
    number of effects at the same time, there is necessary to change
    only a single value from the source file (<b>globals.h</b>) and
    to recompile the program</li>
  <li>Intuitive and easy
    to use <b>User Interface</b> with Clipboard and many objects has
    user presets</li>
  <li><b>Midi</b>
    support (supports many controllers) and (if you want) <b>JACK</b>
    support</li>
  <li>A built-in
    <b>Virtual Keyboard</b> which let you to use it even if you don't
    have a real midi keyboard</li>
  <li>The graphical user
    interface can be completely disabled if the user need so</li>
  <li>It is a
    <b>free</b> program, licensed under <b>version 2</b> of the
    <b>GNU General Public License</b>
  </li>
  <li>LASH support</li>
  <li>DSSI audio output</li>
  <li>Over 300
    high quality instruments included</li>
  <li>Many other
    features... It is is impossible to describe all this program's
    features in just a page</li>
    </ul>
