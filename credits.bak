    <h2>Nasca Octavian Paul:</h2>
    <p>I am a 24 (Apr. 2005) years boy from Romania
    who is interested in computers, music, etc. I graduated the
    studies at Mathematics-Computer science university from my town,
    Tg. Mures.</p>
    <p>I started to program in 1992. About that year I
    started to be interested in music. The problem was that the
    keyboard that I wanted was much too expensive for me. This made me
    start studding how I can use the computer as synthesizer.
    So, I had written my first synthesizer. I won the third prize for
    it at programming national contest for it. After that, I have
    written a new synth "Paul's Sound's Designer", and put it on the
    net at <a href=
    "http://www.harmony-central.com/Software/Dos/">www.harmony-central.com</a>
    . The sounds made by it were very good; many ideas from it I used
    in ZynAddSubFX as ADsynth. After that I started to write
    another synth based on filtering harmonics from white noise, but
    I didn't finished it. Anyway the ideas from it I called SUBsynth
    and I implemented in ZynAddSubFX. All these programs were written
    for DOS, because the computer I had was an 486.</p>
    <p>In March 2002 I started to write ZynAddSubFX.
    I hope that this program will help many people to make music.</p>

    <h2>Mark McCurry:</h2>
    <p>I am a GNU/Linux user from the USA that likes to program in my free time.
    After I found ZynAddSubFX, it seemed like a good and very interesting
    program that could be updated.
    In January 2009 I began creating patches for some issues with the CVS head.
    Later in Feburary I joined the project.
    From then forward I have tried to help improve ZynAddSubFX.
    I am currently trying to document, test, simplify, and expand the internal
    of this softsynth.</p>
    
    <p>For those who had seen this website previously I am responsible for the
    alterations to it.</p>

    <h2>Harald Hvaal:</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm a Norwegian linux user sharing the hobbies of the two people
	above. I'm the most recent newcomer to zynaddsubfx development. I joined this
	project a little while after discovering ZynAddSubFX; my first impression was
	that it's the greatest synth around, but didn't quite do it right with the user
	interface. For this reason I decided to pitch in with my experience in Qt
	development, and I am currently working on a whole new user interface for zyn
	that works nicely with the other new yet-to-be-announced features coming.</p>
