<blockquote>- <b>Freemode </b>- Enable the Envelope's Free Mode. If the
envelope has the freemode enabled, it alows you to edit directly the envelope's
graph. Select a point from the graph and move it. Notice that ONLY THE
LINE BEFORE THE ENVELOPE'S CURRENTLY EDITED POINT changes it's duration.
If a point is being dragged, the text from right, shows you the duration
of the line before it. Otherwise, the text shows the envelope's total duration.
<br>If the envelope hasn't the freemode enabled, it doesn't allow to move
the points; the envelope window is usefull to see what happens if you chant
the ADSR settings.
<br>- <b>Add Point </b>- add a point after the current point
<br>- <b>Delete Point</b> - delete the current point
<br>- <b>Sust</b> - set the sustain point. If the point is 0, the sustain
is disabled
<br>- <b>Str</b>.- Envelope Stretch
<br>- <b>L</b> - if the envelope is Amplitude Envelope, it makes the envelope
Linear, otherwise, it's logarithmic (dB)
<br>- <b>frcR</b> - forces the release. When the key is released, the envelope's
position jumps directly to the point after the release point. If the release
is disabled, on the key release,&nbsp; the evelope position jumps to the
last point.</blockquote>

<p><img SRC="images/ui02.png" NOSAVE height=478 width=413>
<p>This controls the microtonal capabilities of the <b>ZynAddSubFX </b>and
some other settings related to tunning<b>.</b>
<blockquote><b>- Enable Microtonal</b> - if you'll disable this the synth
will use Equal Temperament 12 notes/octave. Otherwise you can input any
scale you desire.
<br>- <b>"A" freq&nbsp;</b> - set the frequency of the "A" key. The standard
is 440.0 Hz
<br>- <b>"A" note</b> - set the midi note number of the "A" key
<br>- <b>Invert keys<i> - </i></b>If you'll enable this, the keyboard will
be turned upside-down. It was to cute ideea to not implement it.
<br>- <b>Center</b> - set the center of inversion of keys. If the center
is 60, the note 59 will become 61, 58 will become 62, 61 will become 59
and so on.
<br>- <b>Name</b> - the name of the scale
<br>- <b>Comment</b> - Comments or description of the scale
<br>- <b>Shift</b> - shift the scale. If the scale is tuned to A you can
easily tune it to another key.
<br>- <b>Tunnings -</b> here you can input your scale by entering all tunnings
for one octave.
<br>You can enter the tunnings in two ways:
<blockquote>- as a the number of cents (1200 cents=1 octave) as a float
number like "100.0", "123.234"
<br>- as a proportion like "2/1" which represents one octave, "3/2" a perfect
fifth, "5734/6561".
<br>"2/1" is equal to "1200.0" cents.</blockquote>
The last entry represents one octave. All other notes are deduced from
theese settings.
<p>- <b>Keyboard Mapping</b> - you can set the midi keyboard to scale degree
mapping. This is used if the scale has more or less than 12 notes/octave.
<blockquote>- You can enable the mapping by pressing "<b>ON</b>" chekbox
<br>- The midi keys below "<b>First note</b>" and above "<b>Last note</b>"
are ignored
<br>- <b>Middle note</b> represents the note where formal octave starts
<br>- <b>The input</b> - you enter the mappings here:
<blockquote>- numbers, represent the order(degree) entered on Tunings Input
(first is 0). This must be less than the number of notes/octave. If you
want that a key to not to be mapped, you enter "x" instead of a number.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
- "<b>Import .SCL file</b>" and "<b>Import .kbm file</b>" imports <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~huygensf/scala">Scala</a>
files. Scala is a powerful software for experimentation with musical tunings
(just intonation scales, microtonal,...etc.). From it's home page you can
download more than 2800 scales which you can import directly in ZynAddSubFX.</blockquote>

index, you can't use the oscillator from a voice with a bigger index (you
can't use the oscillator of voice 8 for voice 4). This is very used because
if you'll use many voices with same oscillator settings, you can use only
one oscillator and put other voices to use this; if you'll change a parameter
of the oscillator, all voices will update this.
<p><b>Type</b>. - select the type of the modullator (Off, Morph, Ring Modullation,

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 2 types of effects: system effects
and insertions effects. The system effects applies to all parts and allows
to set the amount of effect that applies on each parts. Also it is possible
to send the system effect's output to other system effect. In the user
interface this is shown as "source->destination". eg. "0->1" means how
much of the system effect 0 is sent to system effect 1.

<p>The insertion effects applies to one part or to master out. You may
use more than one insertion effects for one part or master out. If you'll
do so the effect with smaller indexes will apply first(eg. first will be
applied the insertion effect no.0, than no.1, ...). If the part selected
for insertion effect is "-1" than, the effect will be disabled; if the
part will be "-2" the effect will be applied to Master Out.

<br><a NAME="w9"></a>9) Resonance
<p>The resonance effect acts as a "ressonance box" or a filter with arbitrary
frequency response. This produces very realistic sounds.
<p><img SRC="images/ui09.png" NOSAVE height=331 width=788>
<p>Resonance parameters:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>the graph</b> lets you to draw it in "freehand"
mode
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>Enable</b> - Turn the Resonance on.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>Max</b> - How strong is the resonance: lower
values has little effect. Use the roller below to set it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -<b> C.f</b> - the center frequency of the graph
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>Oct</b>. - How many octaves the graph represents
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>Amplification</b> - how the output signel is
amplified
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>Zero</b> - clears the graph
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>Smooth</b> - smooth the graph
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>P.1st</b> - don't allow to the fist harmonic
(fundamental freq.) to be damped
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>InterpP</b> - interpolate the peaks. This alows
you to make very easy resonance functions. First, clear the graph using
the "Zero" buton. Press the left button on some graph's posistions. Press
the "InterpP" button. It will interpolate automatically between the positions
that you pointed (or drawn). Also you can clear a part of the graph by
dragging with the right mouse button. In fact, the "interpP" button interpolates
between non-zero values. If you press the "InterpP" with right mouse button,
the interpolation will be linear, and if you will use the left button,
the interpolation will be smooth.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>RND1,RND2,RND3</b> - makes random resonance
functions
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>Close</b> - closes the window
<p>The cursor location is shown below the graph (the frequency - kHz and
amplitude - dB).

<p><a NAME="w10"></a>10) Instrument banks
<p>The instruments can be stored in banks. Theese are loaded/saved automatically
by the program, you don't have to worry about saving the banks before the
program exits. On the program starts, the last used bank is loaded. A single
bank can store up to 128 instruments.
<p><img SRC="images/ui10.png" NOSAVE height=460 width=782>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the bank has 3 modes:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- <b>READ</b> - the instrument is loaded from the bank to the current part.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- <b>WRITE</b> - the instrument is written to bank
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- <b>CLEAR</b> - the instrument from the bank is cleared (removed)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - pressing <b>left mousebutton</b> on a slot reads/writes/clears
the instrument from/to it (according to the current mode)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - pressing <b>right mousebutton</b> on a slot changes
it's name
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - "<b>Load/Use Bank from file...</b>" loads a bank
from the file and makes it current bank
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - "<b>Save Bank...</b>" save the bank to a file
and makes the saved file&nbsp; current bank. It is usefull only when you
want to copy a bank to a file. Please notice that the current bank is automatically
saved when the program exits or when the bank is changed and you don't
have to save the changes of a bank.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - "<b>New Bank...</b>" Makes a new bank.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>auto close </b>- Close the window after the
instrument was loaded
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>Close</b> - closes the window
<br>If the bankfile is readonly, it is shown as "<b>LOCKED</b>" and the
changing it is not allowed. If you still want to make changes to it, click
on "Save Bank..." to save a copy and do the changes on that copy.

<br><a NAME="w11"></a>11) Virtual Keyboard
<p>The virtual keyboard lets you to play notes using the keyboard/mouse.
There is no midi requirement.
<br><img SRC="images/ui13.png" NOSAVE height=156 width=658>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the keyboard: the keyboard is splitted in
two "octaves"(in fact is more than 1 octave). It may happens that the keys
will not trigger any noteon. This is because another widget than the keyboard
itself is selected. In order to continue playing using the keyboard, click
with the mouse on some keys from the virtual keyboard.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the mouse: you can use the mouse too, to play
. If you press the shift key while pressing the mouse button, the keys
will be not relased when the mouse button is released.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you press the "Panic" button from the ZynAddSubFX
main window, all keys will be released.
<p><b>Functions:</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Ch</b>. - set the midi channel
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Vel</b> - set the noteon velocities
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Oct</b> - transpose all the virtual keyboard
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> "qwer..." </b>Oct - transpose the upper keys
("qwert"); the range of theese keys is from C-4 to A-5 (replace the '5'
with the octave)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> "zxcvb..."</b> Oct - transpose the lower keys
("zxcvb"); the range of theese keys is from C-3 to E-4 (replace the '4'
with the octave)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Controller</b> - set what controller to be changed
according to <b>Cval</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Cval </b>- change the controller value (please
notice that the <b>Cval</b> might not reflect what is the ZynAddSubFX internal
value of the controller; this happens when you change the controller)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp; Pwh </b>- Pitch Wheel, press the "<b>R</b>" button
to reset it
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Close </b>- closes the window

<p>Using this window, you can configure some important settings of ZynAddSubFX.
<br><img SRC="images/ui14.png" NOSAVE height=436 width=253>
<center>
<p><b>Note: All theese settings take effect only after the ZynAddSubFX
is restarted.</b></center>

<p><b>Sample Rate </b>- set the quality of the sound, higher is better,
but it consumes more CPU time. You can set from a list, or if you want
a samplerate that is not on the list, select "Custom" and change the value
from the right. Default is 44100.
<br><b>Buffer Size</b> - set the granularity of the sound. Default is 256
samples. To find out the internal delay in milliseconds, divide the Buffer
Size value, by Sample Rate and multiply the result by 1000 (eg: 256/44100*1000=5.8
ms)
<br><b>OscilSize</b> - set the number of the points of the ADsynth oscillator.
The bigger is better, but it takes more CPU time on start of any note.
Default is 512.
<br><b>Swap Stereo</b> - if the pan positions are reversed, check or uncheck
this button
<p>Some of the folowing settings might be ignored. For example the "OSS
Sequencer Device" is ignored, if the ALSA is used for midi in (set on the
compile time), or Linux settings on Windows systems.
<p><b>Linux</b> -<b> OSS Wave Out Device</b> - set the audioout device
(soundcard). Default is "/dev/dsp"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>OSS Sequencer
Device</b> - set the sequencer (midi in) device. Default is "/dev/sequencer"
<br><b>Windows </b>-<b> Midi In Dev </b>- set the midi in device

<p>With this you can make drum kits, layered instruments, or you can combine
more instruments into one.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Kit Mode </b>- enable the kit mode
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Protect the kit </b>- when loading a instrument,
only the item 0 will be changed, other items will be leaved in place. This
alows you to combine more instruments. If you want to add more instruments
to the kit, you have to copy the item 0 to another item, because the item
0 will be replaced. If you load master settings or if you clear the instrumet/master
setting, the kit is cleared
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Swap/Copy</b> - swaps two items or copy a item
to other item.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kit's items are used to make complex instrument.
The item 0 is a special type: it cannot be disabled (but it can be muted),
to edit it you have to use "ADs edit" or "SUBs edit" from the part window.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>No</b> - number of the
item
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> M&nbsp;</b> - mute an
item of the kit
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Min.k </b>- minimum key
of the kit's item
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> m/R/M</b> - set the last
played note to the minimum(m)/maximum(M) or reset min/max defaults(R)

<p><a NAME="extprg"></a><b><font size=+3>External Programs</font></b></center>

<p>External Programs are distributed with ZynAddSubFX, but there are not
a part of it, because they can be used with any other synthesizer (or midi
device). Both uses ALSA and they must be connected with <i>acconect</i>
or <i>alsa-patch-bay</i>.
<p><b><font size=+1>1) Spliter</font></b>
<p><img SRC="images/ep01.png" NOSAVE height=100 width=383>
<p>This program helps you to play to 2 instruments same time, by splitting
a midi channel to other midi channels.
<p><b>Input Channel</b> - The channel which is being splitted.
<br><b>Split Note</b> - The notes below it are send to <b>Output Channel
1</b>, and the notes above it are sent to <b>Output Channel 2.</b>
<br><b>Tr.1(oct) </b>and <b>Tr.2(oct)</b> - transpose in octaves of output
channel 1 and 2
<p><b><font size=+1>2) Controller</font></b>
<br><img SRC="images/ep02.png" NOSAVE height=436 width=348>
<p>With this program you can control up to 6 controllers/NRPNs same time
with the mouse.
<br>The program was written for mouses with 3 buttons, so "But.1 X" means
X movement (left-right) of buton 1 (left ) of the mouse. Right mouse button
is "But.3" and middle "But.2".
<br>"Val.1" and "Val.2" represents the leftmost/rightmost or up/down values
(depends on X/Y movement).
